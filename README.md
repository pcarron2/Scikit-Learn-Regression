Regression with Scikit-Learn

Scikit-Learn is used to create a data processiong pipeline and generate predictions using several regression methods. The pipeline includes polynomial expansion, feature selection, cross-validation, and algorithm specific hyper-parameter tuning. Decision Tree, Ridge, Lasso, KNN, Gradient Boosting, and Sopport Vector Regression methods are explored on two data sets.
