Regression with Scikit-Learn

Scikit-Learn is used to create a data processiong pipeline and generate predictions using several regression methods. The pipeline includes polynomial expansion, feature selection, cross-validation, and algorithm specific hyper-parameter tuning. Decision Tree, Ridge, Lasso, KNN, Gradient Boosting, and Sopport Vector Regression methods are explored on two data sets.

Pandas and matplotlib are used to explore the data sets and create accuracy plots.
